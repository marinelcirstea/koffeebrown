Website for Tanning Business

The website is built in HTML, CSS and a bit of JS/JQuery
 - Each html file has its own Css style file
 - The header and footer are loaded with jQuery as templates (or global code if you will)
 
 Before you go ahead and use it, please keep in mind that this project is the starting code I wrote
 to get the website up and running, NOT the end product
 
 So: The HTML and CSS files should be cleaned up.
 
 You can import any html file/snippet/block of code, whatever, 
 by creating a div, section, span, etc with the id="include-fileName.html"
 You can edit the "include-" with whatever you want (like "import-") if you edit the JS file.
 
 Have fun.
